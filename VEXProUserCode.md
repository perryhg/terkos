# VEXPro User Code Package #

The VEXPro User Code can be downloaded [here](http://code.google.com/p/terkos/downloads/list).  It is recommended that you download and install this package after downloading and installing the [TerkIDE](http://code.google.com/p/terk-ide/wiki/QuickstartGuide).  Inside this package are the VEXPro sensor, motor and hardware interface library (libqwerk) and various example programs.

### libqwerk ###

Libqwerk is a C++ library that interacts directly with the VEXPro hardware.  It contains several classes, one for each type of peripheral on the VEXPro.  Please refer to the [online documentation](http://content.vexrobotics.com/vexpro_api/index.html).  These docs can also be found on your local machine after the VEXPro User Code package has been installed -- look in `C:\OpenEmbedded\src\libqwerk\doc\html\index.html` if you are running Windows or
`/usr/local/terkos/arm/src/libqwerk/doc/html/index.html` if you are running Linux.
