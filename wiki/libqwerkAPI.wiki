= Libqwerk: The Programmer's API =

Libqwerk is a C++ library that gives you direct access to the VEXPro ARM9's hardware peripherals.  If you want to write a program that moves motors or reads sensors, you will call methods in libqwerk.  

The documentation for libqwerk is kept in a couple places.  It's installed on your computer when you install the TerkIDE, and it's online.  If you are running Windows, the main doc index is located here:

c:\cygwin\usr\local\terkos\arm\src\libqwerk\doc\html\index.html

If you are running Linux, the main index is here:

/usr/local/terkos/arm/src/libqwerk/doc/html/index.html

Just point your favorite browser to this file.  

Or you can find the most recent docs [http://content.vexrobotics.com/vexpro_api/ online].

Accessing the documentation on your computer is a good idea because you can be sure that the documentation is consistent with the version of libqwerk you are using.  Set a bookmark in your browser so you can refer to it easily.
