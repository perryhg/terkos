#summary How to upload firmware into your VEXPro ARM9.

= Uploading Firmware Into Your VEXPro ARM9 =

The VEXPro ARM9's firmware can be completely restored or upgraded through the serial “Console” port on the side of the VEXPro.  This requires a USB Mini B cable that are commonly available through computer/electronics stores.  The Firmware Reimaging Utility for Windows is available [http://code.google.com/p/terkos/downloads/detail?name=vexpro_arm9_firmware_reimager-1.0.exe&can=2&q here].  Additionally, you will need to install the correct serial driver, which can be downloaded through [http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm ftdi.com]. 

After you have downloaded and installed the correct drivers for your version of Windows, you are ready to run the VEXPro ARM9 Firmware Reimager, which can be launched from the Start menu after you've installed it.

When running the Reimager utility, simply select “Upload firmware” from the File menu and it will ask you to select the firmware package.  Browse to the firmware package you wish to upload and select it, or select the firmware in the default directory, which is the most recent firmware package.  Next, follow the directions on the screen.  

Firmware reimaging usually takes 10 to 15 minutes to complete.  Exit the utility when it completes.
