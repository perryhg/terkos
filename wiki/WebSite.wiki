The VEXPro features an on-board web site for various configuration and diagnostics.  Access the site with your favorite web browser by entering the VEXPro's IP address (which you can obtain via the LCD Menu's *Wireless Networking* -> *Wireless Status* -> *Info* menu option).  The web site is password-protected with a username of *admin* and the default password *password*.

  * *[WebSite#Wireless_Networking Wireless Networking]*
  * *[WebSite#User_Programs User Programs]*
  * *[WebSite#Passwords Passwords]*

===Wireless Networking===
The Wireless Networking tab provides controls for specifying which wireless network(s) you want the VEXPro to join, and in what order.  If none of your preferred networks is available, the VEXPro defaults to joining the first open network it can, sorted by signal strength.  You can add both open (unencrypted) and encrypted networks to your set of preferred networks.
